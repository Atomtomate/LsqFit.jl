# TODO for Optim.jl
* more tests for curve_fit()
* more documentation
* reduce / remove dependency on Optim.jl?  (this is buried in `levenberg_marquardt`)

# Things to consider
* tweak a lighterweight package that does not have Distribution dependency?
* simple linear fitting?
* use DualNumbers for finite difference (like in Optim.jl)? 
* add algorithms besides Levenberg-Marquardt?
